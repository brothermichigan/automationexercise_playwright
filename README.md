# Automation Exercises - Playwright

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to write automation in Typescript using Microsoft Playwright through an implementation of the tests at https://automationexercise.com. The goal is simply to implement all of the tests as written rather than to provide a comprehensive test suite for the entire storefront.
